# 🧠 Neural Network Architectures for Predicting Time-Series Data from CFD Simulations

This project explores the use of deep learning models—**Fully Connected Neural Networks (FCNN)** and **Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTM)**—as surrogate models to predict **aerodynamic force coefficients (Cd, Cl)** and **pressure distributions** from CFD simulations of a **transversely oscillating cylinder**.

The goal is to offer a lightweight, fast, and accurate alternative to running repeated, computationally expensive CFD simulations—especially useful for control, optimization, and real-time applications.

## 🌀 CFD Simulation Setup

CFD data is generated using [ml-cfd-lecture by Andre Weiner](https://github.com/AndreWeiner/ml-cfd-lecture) with modifications for an oscillating cylinder setup using OpenFOAM.
